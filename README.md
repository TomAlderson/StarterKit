#StarterKit
----------

**Summary**
-----------
Starter Kit is a pattern library designed to make your life simpler by setting you up with the basic stylings and scripts we think you need to get your website running in a single day, why setup your own styles and scripts when you can have a handy toolbox full of them to begin with? Fully cutomisable and supported by all browsers, there's a range of components and styles available for all of your needs.

**What does Starter Kit include?**

Starter Kit comes stacked with 8 components, ranging from Navigation Bars to Buttons to Fixed Warning Messages, along with preset styles for columns, borders, content alignment, fonts and much more; to fully understand the gratitude of materials available in the kit, check the documentation below.

**What fonts and images does Starter Kit come with?**

There are two font-types that are included within the Starter Kit libary, these are 'Font Awesome'; a brilliantly designed open-source icon font for all your basic graphical needs and 'Socicon'; another font full of icons that are catered towards popular social networks in font format. The included images are held all in a folder labelled 'Entypo'; another icon set which is available in .svg format for both standard & retina capabilities.

**What is a component?**

Components are styled 'boxes' or tools that you can implement on your website, such as a teaser, a banner with the option to enable a carousel or a navigation bar, these are standard areas of a web page which are mostly, if not always, included and we felt it was time for a different set of styles to enter the battle field!

## Get Started ##
----------
Installing Starter Kit is so simple and takes minimal effort, simply download the zip file by clicking on the folder labelled SKit above, or click here. Once download has completed, simply extract the compressed folder to a destination of your choice and begin creating your website in the root directory.

Both dependency files are also available in a minified version to save load-time on your website, to use the minified versions instead, just add .min before the file extension.

**Locally Hosted Files (Recommended)**

To begin, enter the code below in the `<head>` section of your website...

    <link href="css/starter-kit.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="js/starter-kit.js"></script>

**Publicly Hosted Files**

Alternatively, you can use the files straight from our repository by using the following code in your `<head>` section of your website...

    <script src="http://files.tomaldy.com/starter-kit/js/starter-kit.js"></script>

Each component within the kit holds it's own example page so you can fully understand how the code works if you're not a fan of documentation, simply find the file name of the component you want to view and open it in your browser or programming software and start disecting.
